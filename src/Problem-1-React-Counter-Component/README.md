# Problem 1 – React Counter Component

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Write a React component that displays a counter and allows the user to increase/decrease said counter. Additionally, add another label that displays counter * 3.

Requirements:
* Counter starts from 0.
* Counter cannot be negative.
* Click the '+' button to increment.
* Click the '-' button to decrement.
* Display counter * 3.
* Write a unit test to verify that clicking the button increments the counter. Can be pseudo or real.
